    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you're lazy like me then you love to automate as much of your process as possible. Running tests from within your IDE is one of those tasks that screams for a keyboard shortcut. In full featured tools like RubyMine or Eclipse this is usually pretty straightforward. However many developers in the Ruby community seem to prefer more lightweight tools like TextMate, Vim and Sublime. Today we'll look at how to setup RubyTest in Sublime Text 2 so we can easily run tests with just a few hotkeys. The tests will be written in <a href="http://rspec.info/">Rspec</a> which should be familiar to most Rubyists.</p>

<h3>How to setup RubyTest in Sublime Text 2</h3>

<p>If you haven't installed the <a href="http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control">Sublime Package Manager</a> go ahead and do that now. The package manager is a wonderful tool that lets us install and update plugins from within Sublime. After you have that installed you can hit <code>cmd-shift-p</code> to open up the Command Palette. Type the following <code>Install Package</code> and press Enter. This will bring up a list of available packages that we can install. You can also type <code>Discover Packages</code> which will take you to a page listing each plugin with a brief description.</p>

<p>Go ahead and type <code>RubyTest</code> and press Enter. You will see a progress indicator at the bottom of your editor. Once it's finished you should be able to click on <code>Tools &gt; RubyTest</code>.</p>

<h3>Running tests in Sublime Text 2</h3>

<p>I've put together <a href="https://github.com/robdodson/testing_demo">a sample project which you can download</a>. It has a Gemfile and a pair of contrived Rspec tests. Put it someplace where you can easily get to it using the command line. In order for RubyTest to work you have to open your projects from the CLI. This has to do with how certain load paths get setup and it's probably the cause of about 95% of RubyTest issues. Follow <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/osx_command_line.html">these instructions</a> if you don't already have the <code>subl</code> command setup in your terminal.</p>

<p><code>cd</code> into the project folder and do a quick <code>bundle install</code>. When that's finished try to run
<code>
bundle exec rspec spec/
</code>
If you see test results then you know that rspec is good to go. Use <code>subl .</code> to open the project. You should see a list of files on your left hand sidebar. Navigate to the <code>spec/robot_spec.rb</code> file. If you're lucky you should be able to hit <code>cmd-shift-t</code> to run all of the tests within the spec. If succesful you'll see a console window that looks like this.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/ruby_test_console.png" title="Ruby Test Console" ></p>

<p>Don't worry if it doesn't work the first time. Sublime and RubyTest are <em>very</em> finicky. Close Sublime and try to open it again from the command line.It might help to close any other Sublime projects you already have open or even quit the program entirely using <code>cmd-q</code>. You'll have to experiment a bit to get it all working.</p>

<p>Hopefully after all that you've got your tests showing up green. Now you can integrate RubyTest into your workflow and save all that alt-tabbing back and forth between the command line!</p>

    <link href="http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/04/28/playing-with-ruby-dates/"/>
    <updated>2012-04-28T07:20:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/04/28/playing-with-ruby-dates</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of <a href="https://vimeo.com/40633070">my previous projects</a> involved a ton of work using Flash's built in Date object. We ended up rolling our own Calendar library which was both tedious and time consuming to debug. Now that I'm digging into Ruby for my newest project, I wanted to see what features the language has to offer. So far I'm <em>really</em> impressed and that's after only a few hours of exploration. I'll detail some of the tricks I've learned along the way so hopefully other newcomers can benefit.</p>

<h3>Ruby Date Object Basics</h3>

<p>We can start off by firing up IRB and requiring the <code>date</code> class. Let's do a really simple example first and just generate today.</p>

<p>```
require 'date'</p>

<p>today = Date.today
 => #&lt;Date: 2012-04-28 ((2456046j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>
```</p>

<p>Now lets try a bit of Ruby's sugar to generate tomorrow's date.</p>

<p><code>
tomorrow = today + 1
 =&gt; #&lt;Date: 2012-04-29 ((2456047j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)&gt;
</code>
Pretty straightforward, right? Since there is usually more than one way to do something in Ruby we could have achieved the same results using any of the following.</p>

<p>```
today.succ
 => #&lt;Date: 2012-04-29 ((2456047j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)></p>

<p>today.next
 => #&lt;Date: 2012-04-29 ((2456047j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)></p>

<p>today.next_day
 => #&lt;Date: 2012-04-29 ((2456047j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>
```</p>

<p>As <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/962544/one-line-hash-creation-in-ruby">someone on StackOverflow pointed out</a>: <code>Date</code> objects are also <code>Comparable</code>, so you can construct a <code>Range</code>. If you wanted to collect every day from the previous week into an array you could do the following:
<code>
last_week = today - 7
every_day_last_week = (last_week..today).to_a
</code></p>

<p>or...</p>

<p><code>
today.downto(today - 7).to_a
</code></p>

<p>There are also some cute booleans tossed into the mix for figuring out the day of the week.</p>

<p>```
today.friday?
 => false</p>

<p>today.saturday?
 => true
```</p>

<h3>How to Use Chronic</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mojombo/chronic/">Chronic</a> is a Ruby natural language date/time parser written by <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/">Tom Preston-Werner</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/mojombo">@mojombo</a>) which takes surprisingly human readable text and converts it to dates.</p>

<p>Covering everything that Chronic supports could take a while so definitely go check out the docs. Below is just a quick example to demonstrate how cool it is.</p>

<p>```
require 'chronic'</p>

<p>Chronic.parse('yesterday')
 => 2012-04-27 12:00:00 -0700</p>

<p>Chronic.parse('yesterday').to_date
 => #&lt;Date: 2012-04-27 ((2456045j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)></p>

<p>Chronic.parse('last monday')
 => 2012-04-23 12:00:00 -0700</p>

<p>Chronic.parse('3 months ago this friday at 3:45pm')
 => 2012-02-04 15:45:00 -0800
```</p>

<h3>How to Use Active Support for Dates</h3>

<p>Active Support is a library extracted from Rails which adds a ton of sugar to the Ruby language. As the author's describe it:</p>

<blockquote><p>Active Support is a collection of various utility classes and standard library extensions that were found useful for Rails. All these additions have hence been collected in this bundle as a way to gather all that sugar that makes Ruby sweeter.</p></blockquote>

<p>It's broken into several pieces so you can choose to load only the parts that you'll actually be using. <em>I'm going to write an upcoming article on Active Support. For now we'll just require it all.</em></p>

<p>```
require 'active_support/all'</p>

<p>t = Date.today
 => Sat, 28 Apr 2012</p>

<p>t.class
 => Date
```</p>

<p>You'll notice that Active Support has changed the way our date's <code>to_s</code> is formatted so it's more human readable. It also added shortcuts for creating Dates on either side of today.</p>

<p>```
yesterday = Date.yesterday
 => Fri, 27 Apr 2012</p>

<p>tomorrow = Date.tomorrow
 => Sun, 29 Apr 2012
```</p>

<p>Included as well are some nice convenience booleans: <code>past?</code>, <code>today?</code>, and <code>future?</code>
<code>
tomorrow.future?
 =&gt; true
</code></p>

<p>If you've ever had to write a Calendar that can support weeks, especially those that straddle two different months, you'll appreciate the simplicity of the helpers Active Support adds.</p>

<p>```
today = Date.today
 => Sat, 28 Apr 2012</p>

<p>today.beginning_of_week
 => Mon, 23 Apr 2012</p>

<p>today.next_week
 => Mon, 30 Apr 2012</p>

<h1>You can also choose to make the week start on an arbitrary day, like Sunday</h1>

<p>today.beginning_of_week(:sunday)
 => Sun, 22 Apr 2012
```</p>

<p>We aren't limited to weeks though. Active Support adds methods for days, months and years. For example:</p>

<p><code>
today.years_ago(10)
 =&gt; Sun, 28 Apr 2002
</code></p>

<p>By extending <code>FixNum</code> to support additional Date methods certain operations become much more readable.</p>

<p><code>
today + 1.year
 =&gt; Sun, 28 Apr 2013
</code></p>

<p>These extensions are referred to as <code>durations</code> <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_support_core_extensions.html">in the documentation</a>.
Which brings us back to one of our first examples of finding the date 7 days ago. With Active Support it's as easy as...</p>

<p><code>
7.days.ago
 =&gt; 2012-04-21 08:44:02 -0700
</code></p>

<p>Pretty cool! Active Support adds <em>A LOT</em> more than just Date helpers and I'll try to cover it more in some future articles. Definitely <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_support_core_extensions.html">check out the documentation</a> (you can <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_support_core_extensions.html#extensions-to-date">skip to the Date section</a> since it's pretty immense).</p>

    <updated>2012-04-27T07:33:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/04/27/how-to-setup-postgresql-for-rails-and-heroku</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Install PostgreSQL Locally</h3>

<p>Ryan Bates has already put together a wonderful Railscast on this topic so feel free to <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/342-migrating-to-postgresql">jump over there</a> to view it. My main goal in writing this post was to distill down what he said, point out a small gotcha along the way and offer some additional tools.</p>

<p>There are a few different options for installing PostgreSQL. The first one, which Ryan outlines, is to use <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a> and simply do a <code>brew install postgresql</code>. Some folks might not be comfortable with that process so I wanted to also recommend the new <a href="http://postgresapp.com/">PostgreSQL.app</a> from the team at <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. If you're more used to tools like <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html">MAMP</a> then the PostgreSQL.app might be a bit more your style.</p>

<p>If you go the Homebrew route make sure you type in <code>initdb /usr/local/var/postgres</code> after the install finishes to init your first database. The installer will also mention some commands you can use to have PostgreSQL auto-start whenever you turn on your computer. I wasn't a big fan of this approach so instead I created two aliases in my .bash_profile.</p>

<p><code>
alias pg-start='pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start'
alias pg-stop='pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres stop -s -m fast'
</code>
With these I can just type <code>pg-start</code> to fire up Postgres and <code>pg-stop</code> when I want to shut it down.</p>

<h3>Change Rails Database to PostgreSQL</h3>

<p>The next thing you'll want to do is either convert an existing project to PostgreSQL or create a new rails project and set PostgreSQL as the database.</p>

<p>Creating a new rails project for Postgres is as easy as <code>rails new blog -d postgresql</code>. After running this command you'll also need to call <code>rake db:create:all</code> to create a new database.</p>

<p>To convert an existing project you'll want to update your Gemfile to include the <code>pg</code> gem. A basic Gemfile might look something like this:</p>

<p>``` ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'</p>

<p>gem 'rails', '3.2.3'
gem 'pg', '~>0.13.2'</p>

<p>group :assets do
  gem 'sass-rails',   '~> 3.2.3'
  gem 'coffee-rails', '~> 3.2.1'
  gem 'uglifier', '>= 1.0.3'
end</p>

<p>gem 'jquery-rails'</p>

<p>```
You'll also need to update your config/database.yml to look for Postgres instead of SQLite or MySQL.</p>

<p>``` yaml config/database.yml
development:
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  database: [insert your dev database name]
  pool: 5
  username: [insert your user name]
  password:</p>

<p>test:
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  database: [insert your test database name]
  pool: 5
  username: [insert your user name]
  password:
<code>``
Since we haven't created any Postgres user accounts both Homebrew and PostgreSQL.app will simply use our current username as the login. The password can remain blank. After this is done you'll also need to call</code>rake db:create:all` to create the new database.</p>

<h3>Connect a Rails Project to a PostgreSQL Database on Heroku</h3>

<p>If your project isn't already under version control then now would be a good time to set that up.</p>

<p><code>
git init
git add .
git commit -m 'Initial commit!'
</code>
Next we'll create a free Heroku instance
<code>
heroku create --stack cedar
</code>
After that's done we'll simply push our project up there.
<code>
git push heroku master
</code>
You might see some deprecation warnings about vendor plugins. For now you can (probably) safely ignore those.</p>

<p>Here's one little gotcha that I seemed to run into. If you try to access your site on Heroku using the <code>heroku open</code> command you might get an error page. You have to make sure to also call <code>heroku run rake db:create:all</code> otherwise your production database will not be in place and your app will fail to connect to it. Speaking of production databases, you should also note that Heroku will overwrite whatever you put into your config/database.yml so you don't have to worry about figuring out all the connection details for their shared services...it'll all just work. Sweet!</p>

<h3>PostgreSQL GUI</h3>

<p>One last tip re: your new Postgres setup. If you're just starting out like me then your command line fu is probably not as strong as you'd like it to be. Personally I really like having a nice GUI to visualize the tables in my database. For MySQL I usually use the awesome (and free) <a href="http://www.sequelpro.com/">SequelPro</a>. For PostgreSQL you can use <a href="http://inductionapp.com/">Induction</a>. It doesn't seem like they have a downloadable binary on their website (weird?) but you can grab one out of <a href="https://github.com/Induction/Induction/downloads">the Github repo's downloads page</a>. Connecting to your Postgres instance can be a little tricky, you have to make sure to use the PostgreSQL adapter, localhost as the hostname, your computer's username as the user and the password can remain blank. You also <em>HAVE</em> to give it a database name (even though it says it's optional) or it will throw a <code>FATAL:  database [your username] does not exist</code>. Here's a screenshot of what mine looks like:</p>

    <link href="http://robdodson.me/blog/2011/09/23/how-to-use-rvm-for-rails3/"/>
    <updated>2011-09-23T07:33:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://robdodson.me/blog/2011/09/23/how-to-use-rvm-for-rails3</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>What is RVM?</h3>

<p><a href="https://rvm.io//">RVM</a> is a great Ruby and gem management tool that should probably be the first thing you install if you’re learning Rails (or Ruby for that matter). The main benefit of RVM is that it helps to keep your rubies and your gems organized into discrete folders which can easily be thrown away and recreated. If you’ve ever had a gem explode on you, then you know how great a feature like this is. I’ll cover the basics of using RVM in this post to quickly get you up and running. This tutorial is written for the OSX terminal, if you're on Windows...um...kill yourself.</p>

<h3>How to Install RVM</h3>

<p>First download and run the RVM installation script. Thankfully the authors have made this nice and easy for you. Just copy and paste the following into your command line:</p>

<p><code>
curl -L get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
</code></p>

<p>Next you’re going to want to make sure that RVM gets loaded into your shell sessions. The easiest way to do this is to open up your .bash_profile file located in your user's home directory (that's what the ~ stands for in your terminal) and add the following to the bottom:</p>

<p><code>
[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] &amp;&amp; . "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" # This loads RVM into a shell session.
</code></p>

<p>Then quit your terminal window and open it up again. You should be able to type: <code>rvm -v</code> to verify that RVM is loaded and ready for use. If instead it just returns the prompt then you've probably missed a step along the way. Check out the <a href="https://rvm.io/rvm/install/">RVM installation page</a> and double check that you've done everything correctly.</p>

<h3>A Guided Tour of RVM's Inner Workings</h3>

<p>To get us started lets look around inside the .rvm directory. Try the following:</p>

<p><code>
cd ~/.rvm
ls
</code></p>

<p>When you list out the contents of rvm you’ll see several folders but the ones we’re most interested in are gems and rubies. The gems folder is going to hold all of our gems after we create a <em>gemset</em>. The rubies folder holds different versions of ruby for us to play with. The really cool thing about RVM is that it lets you swap versions of ruby and different gemsets around so you can test out new packages without blowing stuff up. Made a mistake and installed the wrong gems? Just blow away the gemset and start over, no need to track everything down and uninstall it. RVM also lets you ensure that you have the same gems running for your dev, test and production environments :)</p>

<p>Now that you have RVM installed, the next thing you’ll want to do is to install the latest version of Ruby. If you haven’t previously installed Ruby and you’re on OSX then typing <code>ruby -v</code> into the command line should produce something like this:</p>

<p><code>ruby 1.8.7 (2009-06-12 patchlevel 174) [universal-darwin10.0]</code></p>

<p>We’re going to leave the default version of Ruby installed on our machine, and instead install a new version using RVM. The current latest version of Ruby is 1.9.3, so try typing:</p>

<p><code>
rvm install 1.9.3
</code></p>

<p>It will take a little while to run but if all goes well we should have a brand new working copy of Ruby.</p>

<p>Now try:</p>

<p>```
rvm use 1.9.3
ruby -v</p>

<h1>ruby 1.9.3p125 (2012-02-16 revision 34643) [x86_64-darwin11.2.0]</h1>

<p>which ruby</p>

<h1>/Users/Rob/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p125/bin/ruby</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>We can see that not only are we running the latest version of ruby, but instead of being stashed in some random system folder somewhere, it’s being kept inside of a directory in RVM. To make sure that every time we open terminal we are using this new version of ruby we’ll simply say:</p>

<p><code>
rvm use 1.9.3 --default
</code></p>

<p>That will tell RVM to use this version as its default Ruby any time we open a terminal session.</p>

<h3>What are RVM Gemsets?</h3>

<p>I have to admit that when I first started using Ruby I found the concept of gems really confusing. In Flash or JavaScript if you want to use some code you just download the folder from github and include it in your project. Ruby does something similar with gems except it tries to automate the process for you and often times this can lead to busted projects. Because some gems rely on other gems it isn’t unheard of to have two gems in conflict which means your project won’t run and if you’re new to ruby or rails this can be just enough to make you call it quits. Here is where RVM really shines because it makes it OK to screw up your gems by sequestering them into their own little packages which you can recreate and destroy at will.</p>

<p>Lets get started by typing:</p>

<p><code>
rvm gemset create my-new-gemset
</code></p>

<p>You should get a confirmation that a new gemset was created as well as a path to the new gemset. Let’s go take a look at that path.</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>Make sure to use the path RVM provided you.</h1>

<p>cd /Users/RobDodson/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p125@my-new-gemset
ls
```</p>

<p>Right now the folder is empty because we haven’t told RVM to install any gems into this gemset. Let’s change that by first assigning our current instance of ruby to this set.</p>

<p><code>
rvm 1.9.3@my-new-gemset --default
</code></p>

<p>The @ character tells RVM that we want to assign this gemset to our current ruby instance. The default flag is just there since I tend to forget to make my gemsets defaults and RVM will reset to whatever the prior default was the last time the flag was set. Let’s verify that things worked by typing:</p>

<p><code>
rvm current
</code></p>

<p>Which should output: <code>ruby-1.9.3-p125@my-new-gemset</code>. Similarly you could type:</p>

<p><code>
rvm gemset list
</code></p>

<p>To see a list of all your gemsets with a hash rocket next to the one currently in use.</p>

<h3>How to Install Gems with RVM</h3>

<p>Ok, so lets install some gems then. We’ll start by installing the Nokogiri gem, just as a test. But before we do this let me give you a little warning. In a lot of documentation you'll see people installing gems with the <code>sudo</code> keyword at the beginning of the commmand. If you're not using RVM then doing it this way makes sense. However if you ARE using RVM then <em>you should never install a gem with <code>sudo</code>!</em> In short, RVM does command line wizardry and installing gems with <code>sudo</code> will place them outside of the .rvm directory. You'll think you've installed a gem properly but really it'll be somewhere in the system folder. To install a gem using RVM we simply leave off the <code>sudo</code> keyword. Let's try one by typing:</p>

<p><code>
gem install nokogiri
</code></p>

<p>After the installation has finished we should be able to see our new gem. If you’re still inside of the gems directory from earlier you can do a <code>cd gems</code>
otherwise you’ll need to dig into it with a path that looks like this</p>

<p><code>cd /Users/RobDodson/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p125@my-new-gemset/gems</code></p>

<p>Now if you type <code>ls</code> you should see your version of nokogiri. Let’s pause for a moment and consider what just happened. If you use Ruby Gems without RVM then everything will be installed in the system folder. If we wanted to have 2 different versions of nokogiri we would need to make sure that there wasn’t any kind of conflict in our gems directory. Since we’re using RVM to manage our gems, we’re able to tell Ruby Gems to put one version of nokogiri in the ‘my-new-gemset’ directory and another version in the ‘some-other-gemset’ directory. This is a great feature, especially when you want to try out an upgrade or a different version of a particular library. Rather than having to uninstall your working gem, you can just create a new gemset. If things blow up then you can throw it away and revert back to the previous gemset.</p>

<p>Lets make another gemset and this time install a new instance of Rails.</p>

<p><code>
rvm create gemset my-new-rails-setup
rvm 1.9.3@my-new-rails-setup
gem install rails
</code></p>

<p>Now lets go into the folder for that gemset. Again the path should look similar to this:</p>

<p><code>cd /Users/RobDodson/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p125@my-new-rails-setup/gems</code></p>

<p>Type <code>ls</code> this time and you’ll see <em>WAY</em> more gems. Imagine that we wanted to test our application on a different version of Rails. Managing all those gems in one directory would be a huge pain but thankfully RVM is taking care of that for us. If we decide that this version of rails is not for us we can just delte the gemset with:</p>

<p><code>
rvm gemset delete my-new-rails-setup
</code></p>

<p>And recreate it however we want :D</p>

<p>That wraps it up for today. If you have any questions you can post a comment or hit me up on twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/robdodson">@rob_dodson</a>.</p>
