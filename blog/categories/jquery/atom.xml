    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week <a href="http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/05/30/using-jquery-deferred-to-load-an-underscore-template/">I did a post on how to load an Underscore template using jQuery's Deferred method</a>. I got some great feedback from folks and decided I should do a follow up showing how to create your own Deferreds.</p>

<h3>What's a Deferred again...?</h3>

<p>So, quick summary time. jQuery has a neat little Object called a <code>Deferred</code> which is basically a wrapper around a function or a group of functions. Let's say that you want to load 3 different json files via ajax and when all that's done you want to let the rest of the world know. Using jQuery's <code>Deferred</code> Object we can actually put a wrapper around those 3 ajax functions and fire off a callback when they've all finished. <a href="http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/05/30/using-jquery-deferred-to-load-an-underscore-template/">Refer back to my previous post (toward the bottom) where I explain some of these callbacks.</a></p>

<p><code>Deferred</code> isn't limited to ajax calls, it can work in just about any environment. Let's do an example using jQuery's animate function. We'll fade an item and when it's finished animating we'll resolve our <code>Deferred</code> object.</p>

<h3>Our First Deferred</h3>

<p>Here's the code we'll be using in our index.html file:</p>

<p>``` html index.html
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head></p>

<pre><code>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Deferred Sandbox&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
  #container {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background: #CCC;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;script src="jquery.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="main.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>  </head>
  <body></p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id="main"&gt;
  &lt;div id="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>  </body>
</html>
```</p>

<p>Take note of the fact that I've included jquery.js and main.js in the same folder as index.html. If you run the above you should get a simple little grey square in the top left of your screen. Now let's dive into the JavaScript.</p>

<p>``` js main.js
var container = {</p>

<pre><code>initialize: function($el) {
    // Store a reference to our element
    // on the page
    this.$el = $el;
},
fadeOut: function() {
    // Create a new Deferred.
    var dfd = new $.Deferred();

    this.$el.animate({
        opacity: 0
    }, 2000, function() {
        // When we're done animating
        // we'll resolve our Deferred.
        // This will call any done() callbacks
        // attached to either our Deferred or
        // one of its promises.
        dfd.resolve("Finished fading out!");
    });

    // Return an immutable promise object.
    // Clients can listen for its done or fail
    // callbacks but they can't resolve it themselves
    return dfd.promise();
}
</code></pre>

<p>};</p>

<p>$(function() {</p>

<pre><code>// Hook the container object up to the #container div
container.initialize($('#container'));

// Instruct the container to fade out. When we call
// fadeOut we should get a promise back as a return value
var promise = container.fadeOut();

// Now that we have a promise we can hook a done callback
// onto it. The done() method will fire once the promise
// is resolved.
promise.done(function(message) {
    console.log(message);
});
</code></pre>

<p>});
```</p>

<p>That's a fair bit of code so let's walk through it bit by bit. We start off by creating an object called <code>container</code> which is going to wrap the <code>#container</code> div already on the page. The real guts of container happens in the <code>fadeOut</code> method:</p>

<p>``` js
fadeOut: function() {</p>

<pre><code>// Create a new Deferred.
var dfd = new $.Deferred();

this.$el.animate({
    opacity: 0
}, 2000, function() {
    // When we're done animating
    // we'll resolve our Deferred.
    // This will call any done() callbacks
    // attached to either our Deferred or
    // one of its promises.
    dfd.resolve("Finished fading out!");
});

// Return an immutable promise object.
// Clients can listen for its done or fail
// callbacks but they can't resolve it themselves
return dfd.promise();
</code></pre>

<p>}
<code>``
The first thing we do is to create a new</code>Deferred<code>using jQuery's Deferred constructor. Ignore the animation function for a moment and look at the bottom of this method. See how we're returning</code>dfd.promise()<code>? A promise is a dynamically generated object which lets clients hook onto our</code>done<code>and</code>fail<code>callbacks but it doesn't let them do anything to change our original</code>Deferred<code>object. A promise is an</code>immutable<code>object, meaning clients can listen to it but they can't really do anything to change it. We want this functionality because we don't want someone else to come along and accidentally resolve our</code>Deferred<code>. So instead of returning the</code>Deferred<code>we just created, we only return its</code>promise`.</p>

<p>OK back to the animation function:</p>

<p>``` js
this.$el.animate({</p>

<pre><code>opacity: 0
</code></pre>

<p>}, 2000, function() {</p>

<pre><code>// When we're done animating
// we'll resolve our Deferred.
// This will call any done() callbacks
// attached to either our Deferred or
// one of its promises.
dfd.resolve("Finished fading out!");
</code></pre>

<p>});
<code>``
If you've used</code>jQuery.animate<code>before this should look pretty straightforward to you. At the end of our animation we pass in an anonymouse function which will be run when the animation completes. In this function we tell our</code>Deferred<code>to resolve. Resolving the</code>Deferred<code>causes any</code>done<code>callbacks to fire. In this case we're also passing along a little snippet of text. When you resolve a</code>Deferred<code>you can give it an optional payload object which will be passed to all the</code>done` callbacks. This is extremely useful if you're using ajax to pass along the final data value. In this case we're just going to log the message into the console:</p>

<p>``` js
promise.done(function(message) {</p>

<pre><code>console.log(message);
</code></pre>

<p>});
<code>``
There are more cool things you can do with</code>Deferreds<code>I highly recommend you [spend some time with the documentation](http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/) and trying out some of the other methods like</code>pipe<code>or</code>resolveWith<code>. Also as a side note [checkout this page](http://api.jquery.com/promise/) which shows how to extract a</code>promise` by type. It will actually let you do everything we've done in our animation example but with fewer lines of code.</p>

<p>Let me know if this is helpful or if you have any questions. Till tomorrow! - Rob</p>

    <updated>2012-05-30T08:53:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/05/30/using-jquery-deferred-to-load-an-underscore-template</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today's post is meant to scratch an itch I had the other day regarding templates. My friend wanted to load an underscore template along with some JSON data but wasn't sure what the best approach would be. Since I'm using Backbone Boilerplate I've gotten used to having my template loading method already stubbed out for me. Here's the one they use:</p>

<p>``` js
fetchTemplate: function(path, done) {
  var JST = window.JST = window.JST || {};
  var def = new $.Deferred();</p>

<p>  // Should be an instant synchronous way of getting the template, if it
  // exists in the JST object.
  if (JST[path]) {</p>

<pre><code>if (_.isFunction(done)) {
  done(JST[path]);
}

return def.resolve(JST[path]);
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  // Fetch it asynchronously if not available from JST, ensure that
  // template requests are never cached and prevent global ajax event
  // handlers from firing.
  $.ajax({</p>

<pre><code>url: path,
type: "get",
dataType: "text",
cache: false,
global: false,

success: function(contents) {
  JST[path] = _.template(contents);

  // Set the global JST cache and return the template
  if (_.isFunction(done)) {
    done(JST[path]);
  }

  // Resolve the template deferred
  def.resolve(JST[path]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>  });</p>

<p>  // Ensure a normalized return value (Promise)
  return def.promise();
}
```</p>

<p>Not having previous experience working with <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/">jQuery.Deferred</a> I was initially put-off by the idea of just copy/pasting this function over to him, especially since I couldn't explain what was going on. I knew that I probably wanted to use Deferreds and Promises but I wasn't sure how best to explain the concepts nor did this method seem to do much in the way of loading JSON, it was just for loading templates. Since my friend only wanted to load 1 template and 1 JSON file I thought it best for us to start small, and to write something that we could easily debug. Knowing I wanted to use Deferreds I found <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/gg723713.aspx">this wonderful article by Addy Osmani and Julian Aubourg</a> detailing how Deferreds work. It is VERY comprehensive and for our purposes I only needed to read the first few paragraphs before I had enough to start.</p>

<p>In a nutshell deferreds are objects which contain promises (also objects). Promises can be in various states, <code>pending</code>, <code>resolved</code> or <code>rejected</code>. Once you have a deferred (or it's promise) you can hook functions on to it so when it changes from a <code>pending</code> to <code>resolved</code> state all those functions fire. It's actually the promise that changes state but you can use the deferred like a promise because in most cases it will just proxy the calls to its promise object. Using deferreds can be nice for several reasons. For starters, you can avoid the jQuery <em>pyramid of doom</em></p>

<p>``` js</p>

<p>// NOOOOOOoooooooooo</p>

<p>$.ajax({
  url: 'foo.php',
  success: function() {</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
  url: 'bar.php',
  success: function() {
    $.ajax({
      url: 'baz.php',
      success: function() {
        ...
      }
    })
  }
})
</code></pre>

<p>  }
})</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Secondly your deferreds/promises are little tokens that you can hand out from your services so other actors don't have to get all up in your ajax guts. Someone makes an API request, you give em a token, when it resolves they play with the data.</p>

<p>``` js
function doSomethingWithHugeData(data) {
  console.log("man, look at all these 1's and 0's!");
}</p>

<p>var dfd = myService.getSomeHugeData();
dfd.done(doSomethingWithHugeData);
```</p>

<p>This is a much nicer approach than passing in a callback that your service will need to execute whenever it finishes getting its data. Your service shouldn't care about your callbacks. It should care about getting data and letting people know when that data's been got! :D</p>

<h3>But I digress...</h3>

<p>We were <em>trying</em> to load some JSON and a template, so let's get back to the task at hand. Since we know that we have two ajax calls, one for the JSON and one for the template, and we know that we don't really want to do anything till both of these calls have completed we've got a perfect use case for <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/">$.when</a>. <code>when</code> accepts a list of deferreds/promises and acts as one big deferred, waiting for all of its children to resolve before it resolves. This is a nice way to build a sequencer. In our case we're going to take  two ajax calls and toss them into <code>$.when</code>. When it resolves we'll use <code>$.then</code> to tell it what our success and failure callbacks should be.</p>

<p>``` html index.html
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head></p>

<pre><code>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Deferred Sandbox&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;script src="jquery.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="underscore.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>  </head>
  <body></p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id="main"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  $(function() {

    function successFunc(jsonRes, templateRes) {
      var json = _.first(jsonRes);
      var template = _.first(templateRes);
      var compiled = _.template(template, json);
      $('#main').html(compiled);
    }

    function failureFunc() {
      console.log('fail whale!');
    }

    $.when(
      $.ajax("person.json"),
      $.ajax("person.template.html")
    ).then(successFunc, failureFunc);

  });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>  </body>
</html>
```</p>

<p>In our case everything is in the same folder as index.html so there's no need for any paths. Keep in mind that in most (all?) browsers you'll need to be running a local server for the above code to actually work. In Chrome, at least, you can't run an html file from file:// and have it load external resources, it'll complain that the access-origin is not allowed.</p>

<p>Let me take a moment to explain <code>$.then</code> a little bit. We know that <code>$.ajax</code> returns a deferred, and that the deferred's promise can be in three states: <code>pending</code>, <code>resolved</code>, <code>rejected</code>. So if we did something like this:</p>

<p><code>js
var dfd = $.ajax('foobar.php');
</code></p>

<p><code>dfd</code> would be a deferred object with a <code>pending</code> promise. Deferred's let us link methods up to them for when their state changes. These methods are: <code>done()</code>, <code>fail()</code>, <code>always()</code>, <code>progress()</code>, and <code>then()</code>. There are more but <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/">I'll let the documentation explain them.</a> <code>done()</code> and <code>fail()</code> each accept either a single callback or an array of callbacks to be fired when the deferred changes to either the <code>resolved</code> or <code>rejected</code> state.</p>

<p>``` js
function successFunc() {
  console.log('success! do stuff with data!');
}</p>

<p>function failureFunc() {
  console.log('failure! um...give up!');
}</p>

<p>var service = {
  getJSON: function() {</p>

<pre><code>return $.ajax('person.json');
</code></pre>

<p>  }
};</p>

<p>service.getJSON()
.done(successFunc)
.fail(failureFunc);</p>

<p>```</p>

<p><code>always()</code> fires its callbacks regardless of whether the deferred was <code>resolved</code> or <code>rejected</code>. This might be a good place to put any cleanup code. <code>progress()</code> is fired during any progress events that the process might emit. Finally there's <code>then()</code> which is what we're using in our template example. <code>then()</code> is essentially shorthand for <code>done()</code> and <code>fail()</code> so you can pass it two callbacks or two arrays of success/fail callbacks.</p>

<p>Hopefully that's helpful for you all and you can go back and clean up some of those pyramids that might be lingering in your code. Till tomorrow! - Rob</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is going to be a bit of lightening post because it's rather late and I need to get to bed. I spent most of the day either eating dim sum or hanging out at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Creative-Coders/">SF Creative Coders BBQ</a> so I've neglected my blogging duties a bit.</p>

<p>I have something which will hopefully be useful for some folks who are getting into CSS3 animations with the Gfx plugin for jQuery. <a href="http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/05/22/css3-transitions-with-gfx/">I've blogged a bit about Gfx before</a> and one of the first things I noticed was the lack of a built in easing library. Coming from the Flash world where <a href="http://www.greensock.com/tweenlite/">TweenLite is king</a> I've grown very accustomed to using Robert Penner's easing equations for great effect. The same equations are used by the jQuery framework to do its animations. Thankfully <a href="http://matthewlein.com/ceaser/">Matthew Lein was kind enough to convert those over to cubic-beziers</a> for those of us doing CSS3 animations. Since Gfx accepts cubic-beziers I moved the equations from Matthew's tool into an AMD compliant module and <a href="https://github.com/robdodson/amd-css3-ease">put it up on Github.</a> It's very simple so if AMD isn't your thing you can just rip those parts out :D</p>

<p>Example usage looks something like this:</p>

<p>``` js
// After requiring the ease module and
// passing it into your View with the
// name 'Ease'</p>

<p>this.$el.gfx({</p>

<pre><code>translateY: '300px'
</code></pre>

<p>}, {</p>

<pre><code>duration: 500,
easing: Ease.easeInExpo 
</code></pre>

<p>});
```</p>

<p>Give it a shot and consider donating to Matthew's project or buying Robert Penner like a million beers!</p>

    <link href="http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/05/24/backbone-events-between-views/"/>
    <updated>2012-05-24T07:23:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/05/24/backbone-events-between-views</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I want to figure out what kind of events to use when one of my views is added to the DOM. This can have a lot of ramifications for positioning elements around the view and setting up properties on the view itself.</p>

<h3>View Events and the DOM</h3>

<p>After looking around for a bit I've found this <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#FAQ-events">list of the events that Backbone can dispatch.</a> Nothing in there about render or adding elements to the DOM :(</p>

<p>More searching reveals that almost everyone points to the <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/livequery">livequery plugin for jQuery.</a> Livequery seems like a mostly deprecated plugin since jQuery has both <code>.live()</code> and <code>.delegate()</code> methods now. The one exception is that livequery will fire a callback when an element is created.</p>

<p>Another alternative is to fire a custom event from my View's render method. While this does seem cleaner than using a plugin unfortunately we might call render over and over again. A middle of the road solution would be to use <code>.one()</code> to bind to the first render event.</p>

<p>In my mind I would like every Backbone View to extend a base class which dispatches a custom <code>addedToDOM</code> event and <code>removedFromDOM</code> event. I'm not sure what the performance cost of using livequery to do this is but let's write it up and maybe we can do a jsPerf later.</p>

<h3>Load a jQuery plugin with AMD</h3>

<p>Let's download livequery <a href="https://github.com/brandonaaron/livequery">from the git repo.</a> Now that we have it we're in another little dilemma. The boilerplate loads jQuery like an AMD module...so how do you use a jQuery plugin with AMD?</p>

<p>It's very possible this is not the intended method but here's how I've gone about solving the problem. Since require.js is only going to load stuff if we specify it as a dependency then we'll need to request the plugin just like any other module. If we put the plugin in our <code>assets/js/plugins</code> folder then we'll already have a path to <code>plugins</code> provided by <code>config.js</code>.</p>

<p>``` js config.js
require.config({
  // Initialize the application with the main application file
  deps: ["main"],</p>

<p>  paths: {</p>

<pre><code>// JavaScript folders
libs: "../assets/js/libs",
plugins: "../assets/js/plugins", // &lt;---- !!! look here! 

// Libraries
jquery: "../assets/js/libs/jquery",
underscore: "../assets/js/libs/underscore",
backbone: "../assets/js/libs/backbone",

// Shim Plugin
use: "../assets/js/plugins/use"
</code></pre>

<p>  },</p>

<p>  use: {</p>

<pre><code>backbone: {
  deps: ["use!underscore", "jquery"],
  attach: "Backbone"
},

underscore: {
  attach: "_"
}
</code></pre>

<p>  }
});
```</p>

<p>Then we can load livequery as if it were any other module. This might seem odd because a dependency gets passed to our pseudo-constructor as an argument:</p>

<p>``` js
define([
  "namespace",</p>

<p>  // Libs
  "use!backbone",</p>

<p>  // Modules</p>

<p>  // Plugins
  "plugins/jquery.livequery"
],</p>

<p>function(namespace, Backbone, livequery) { // &lt;-- see how livequery is passed</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>But we're not going to use that argument. It's just there to make sure that <code>jquery.livequery.js</code> gets added to the page. We'll ignore it and use livequery via jquery instead, like so:</p>

<p>``` js
$('#sections').livequery(function() {</p>

<pre><code>console.log('sections added to DOM!');
</code></pre>

<p>}, function() {</p>

<pre><code>console.log('sections removed from DOM!');
</code></pre>

<p>});
<code>``
Keep in mind that require.js and AMD are just tacking the script elements onto the page. Requiring our plugin in this fashion is no different than tacking a</code>script` onto the HTML at runtime.</p>

<p>Here's my example.js file <a href="http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/05/23/how-do-you-switch-between-views-in-backbone/">from the last post</a>, now using livequery to listen for when the element is added to and removed from the DOM.</p>

<p>``` js example.js
define([
  "namespace",</p>

<p>  // Libs
  "use!backbone",</p>

<p>  // Modules</p>

<p>  // Plugins
  "plugins/jquery.livequery"
],</p>

<p>function(namespace, Backbone, livequery) {</p>

<p>  // Create a new module
  var Example = namespace.module();</p>

<p>  // Example extendings
  Example.Model = Backbone.Model.extend({ /<em> ... </em>/ });
  Example.Collection = Backbone.Collection.extend({ /<em> ... </em>/ });
  Example.Router = Backbone.Router.extend({ /<em> ... </em>/ });</p>

<p>  // This will fetch the tutorial template and render it.
  Example.Views.Tutorial = Backbone.View.extend({</p>

<pre><code>template: "app/templates/example.html",

render: function(done) {
  var view = this;

  // Fetch the template, render it to the View element and call done.
  namespace.fetchTemplate(this.template, function(tmpl) {
    view.el.innerHTML = tmpl();

    // If a done function is passed, call it with the element
    if (_.isFunction(done)) {
      done(view.el);
    }
  });
}
</code></pre>

<p>  });</p>

<p>  Example.Views.Left = Backbone.View.extend({</p>

<pre><code>tagName: 'div',
id: 'left-container',
className: 'container'
</code></pre>

<p>  });</p>

<p>  Example.Views.Middle = Backbone.View.extend({</p>

<pre><code>tagName: 'div',
id: 'middle-container',
className: 'container'
</code></pre>

<p>  });</p>

<p>  Example.Views.Right = Backbone.View.extend({</p>

<pre><code>tagName: 'div',
id: 'right-container',

<p>I tried this out by adding and removing the <code>Example.Sections</code> view from the DOM and both console logs fired, so yeah, awesome! In lieu of creating a base class and adding an addedToDOM and removedFromDOM event we can do something like this to achieve that effect:</p>

<p>``` js example.js
initialize: function() {
  this.leftView = new Example.Views.Left();
  this.middleView = new Example.Views.Middle();
  this.rightView = new Example.Views.Right();</p>

<p>  this.$el.append(this.leftView.render().el);
  this.$el.append(this.middleView.render().el);
  this.$el.append(this.rightView.render().el);</p>

<p>  _.bindAll(this); // make sure all the methods of our object have the right 'this'</p>

<p>  $('#sections').livequery(this.onAddedToDOM, this.onRemovedFromDOM);
},</p>

<p>onAddedToDOM: function() {
  console.log('added to DOM!');
},</p>

<p>onRemovedFromDOM: function() {
  console.log('removed from DOM!');
},
```</p>
