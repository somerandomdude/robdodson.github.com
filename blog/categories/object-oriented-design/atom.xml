    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm picking up from where I left off last night. If you look back at the <a href="/blog/2012/05/06/object-oriented-scraper-backed-with-tests/">previous post</a> we ended with a spec'd out <code>Runner</code> object. Now we need to build our <code>Crawler</code> which will slurp up all the content from our posts and return them as meaningful data.</p>

<p>Our Crawler will have 2 main responsibilities. First it will iterate over a post and return a Hash of words and their usage count. Second, it will iterate over a post and pull out any metadata and associate that with a Date. These are rather simple goals and if you remember from our original scraper we were actually hitting every post on the main page. I think I'd like to nail down these simple functions and then refactor the Crawler to accept a corpus page full of links—<a href="http://robdodson.me/blog/archives/">like our archives page</a>—which it will follow and parse. Right now I want to start small.</p>

<p>Here's a list of what I <em>think</em> would be good tests for our <code>Crawler</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li>It should return an instance in exchange for a valid URI. Since the URI comes from the Runner and that's already being tested we'll assume that the URI we're given is valid.</li>
<li>It should respond to a <code>get_word_counts</code> method.</li>
<li>The get_word_counts method should accept a selector <code>String</code> and return a <code>Hash</code> of words and their counts. Since the selector will be coming from the Runner we'll assume it's valid too but first we'll need to put another test in our <code>runner_spec.rb</code>.</li>
<li>It should respond to a <code>get_metadata</code> method.</li>
<li>The get_metadata method should also accept a selector <code>String</code> and return a <code>Hash</code> with a valid <code>Date</code> and each piece of metadata categorized. Let's see how far we can take this by converting strings related to time into <code>Time</code> objects and any categories with multiple entries into <code>Arrays</code>.</li>
</ul>


<p>I'm actually going to copy and paste the above list into my specs and start buliding from there.</p>

<p>....</p>

<p>Hmm... actually I'm not. Something about this doesn't feel right. <code>Runner</code> has accrued too much responsibility. It's supposed to validate 3 different strings parsed from a YAML file which it loads and then it also has to deal with creating and running the <code>Crawler</code>. I think it's time for another object. Which we'll call <code>Options</code>. Options will be in charge of loading our YAML and verifying that all the values are valid. <code>Runner</code> will create both an Options and a Crawler object and pass the values from Options to Crawler. This is actaully also in line with the Pickaxe book's Anagrams example, so we have a nice guide to follow in that.</p>

<p>OK so <code>Options</code>, eh? Well we'll need to spec out its responsibilities. I think we can just take the tests we wrote for Runner and move them over to Options.</p>

<p>After doing this for while I've ended up with a TON of tests...only to validate 3 variables.</p>

<p>```ruby tentacles/spec/options_spec.rb
require_relative '../lib/tentacles/options'
require 'yaml'
require 'uri'
require 'helpers'</p>

<p>describe Tentacles::Options do
  include Helpers</p>

<p>  before do</p>

<pre><code>@options = Tentacles::Options.new(relative_path + '/../lib/tentacles/config.yml')
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  subject { @options }</p>

<p>  it { should respond_to(:uri) }
  it { should respond_to(:post_selector) }
  it { should respond_to(:metadata_selector) }</p>

<p>  describe "when parsing the config file" do</p>

<pre><code>it "should raise an exception if the config file is missing" do
  expect { options = Tentacles::Options.new('') }.to raise_error(Errno::ENOENT)
  expect { options = Tentacles::Options.new(nil) }.to raise_error(TypeError)
end

it "should raise an exception if the config file is invalid" do
  expect { options = Tentacles::Options.new(relative_path + '/mocks/invalid_yaml.yml') }.to raise_error(Psych::SyntaxError)
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  describe "when parsing the URI" do</p>

<pre><code>it "should display the right URI" do
  uri = URI.parse('http://robdodson.me')
  @options.uri.should eq(uri)
end

it "should raise an exception if uri is empty" do
  expect { options = Tentacles::Options.new(relative_path + '/mocks/blank_uri.yml') }.to raise_error(Psych::SyntaxError)
end

it "should raise an exception if uri is invalid" do
  expect { options = Tentacles::Options.new(relative_path + '/mocks/invalid_uri.yml') }.to raise_error(Psych::SyntaxError)
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  describe "when parsing the post selector" do</p>

<pre><code>it "should have a post_selector" do
  @options.post_selector.should be('.entry-content')
end

it "should raise an exception if the post selector is empty" do
  expect { options = Tentacles::Options.new(relative_path + '/mocks/blank_uri.yml') }.to raise_error(Psych::SyntaxError)
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  describe "when parsing the metadata selector" do</p>

<pre><code>it "should have a metadata_selector" do
  @options.metadata_selector.should be('.personal-metadata')
end

it "should raise an exception if the metadata selector is empty" do
  expect { options = Tentacles::Options.new(relative_path + '/mocks/blank_uri.yml') }.to raise_error(Psych::SyntaxError)
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Here's my implementation of <code>options.rb</code>
```ruby tentacles/lib/tentacles/options.rb
require 'yaml'</p>

<p>module Tentacles
  class Options</p>

<pre><code>attr_reader :uri
attr_reader :post_selector
attr_reader :metadata_selector

def initialize(config)
  @config = YAML.load(File.open(config))

  @uri = URI.parse(@config[:uri])
  raise IOError, 'invalid uri!' if @uri.scheme.nil? || @uri.host.nil?

  @post_selector = @config[:post_selector]
  raise IOError, 'post_selector is not defined' if @post_selector.empty? 

  @metadata_selector = @config[:metadata_selector]
  raise IOError, 'metadata_selector is not defined' if @metadata_selector.empty? 
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Seems like now might be a good time to pause for a bit. When I look at those tests I see a lot of places where I'm testing Classes that have probably already been tested. I feel like you can safely assume that if you pass <code>YAML.load</code> a bunch of junk it's going to throw an error. Is there any value in testing something like that for my own implementation? I'm guessing not. However I do think it's important that I test the 3 exceptions that I wrote. I'll get all the tests to pass and then I'll go back and clean it up.</p>

<h3>Making the Tests Pass</h3>

<p>I like to comment out my spec file and go line by line making each test pass as I go. I'm pretty good at writing failing tests (heh) so this approach adheres well to the red, green, refactor mantra.</p>

<p>Starting out I have a problem in the first block which checks my <code>attr_readers</code>:</p>

<p><code>ruby
it { should respond_to(:uri) }
it { should respond_to(:post_selector) }
it { should respond_to(:metadata_selector) }
</code></p>

<p>Let's see if I can get just the first test to pass... I comment out everything inside of Options and notice that YAML does not use symbols for keys. It seems like loaded YAML uses Strings for keys. After changing my symbol keys to strings my first block of tests pass.</p>

<p>```ruby tentacles/lib/tentacles/options.rb
require 'yaml'</p>

<p>module Tentacles
  class Options</p>

<pre><code>attr_reader :uri
attr_reader :post_selector
attr_reader :metadata_selector

def initialize(config)
  @config = YAML.load(File.open(config))

  @uri = URI.parse(@config["uri"])
  raise IOError, 'invalid uri!' if @uri.scheme.nil? || @uri.host.nil?

  @post_selector = @config["post_selector"]
  raise IOError, 'post_selector is not defined' if @post_selector.empty? 

  @metadata_selector = @config["metadata_selector"]
  raise IOError, 'metadata_selector is not defined' if @metadata_selector.empty? 
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>The next block passes quite easily because it's ported over from the <code>Runner</code> class</p>

<p>```ruby
describe "when parsing the config file" do</p>

<pre><code>it "should raise an exception if the config file is missing" do
  expect { options = Tentacles::Options.new('') }.to raise_error(Errno::ENOENT)
  expect { options = Tentacles::Options.new(nil) }.to raise_error(TypeError)
end

it "should raise an exception if the config file is invalid" do
  expect { options = Tentacles::Options.new(relative_path + '/mocks/invalid_yaml.yml') }.to raise_error(Psych::SyntaxError)
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
```</p>

<p>After that we run into some issues because our next set of tested exceptions have the wrong class.</p>

<p>```ruby
  describe "when parsing the URI" do</p>

<pre><code>it "should display the right URI" do
  uri = URI.parse('http://robdodson.me')
  @options.uri.should eq(uri)
end

it "should raise an exception if uri is empty" do
  expect { options = Tentacles::Options.new(relative_path + '/mocks/blank_uri.yml') }.to raise_error(Psych::SyntaxError)
end

it "should raise an exception if uri is invalid" do
  expect { options = Tentacles::Options.new(relative_path + '/mocks/invalid_uri.yml') }.to raise_error(Psych::SyntaxError)
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
<code>``
Changing the last two exceptions to expect</code>Errno::ENOENT<code>and</code>URI::InvalidURIError` in that order fixes things and we're all green again.</p>

<p>In the next block we have 2 failing tests because the first one is using improper syntax. Instead of <code>be</code> we should be using <code>eq</code>. Seems like in RSpec <code>be</code> is equivalent to === and not ==. Also we have another PSYCH::SyntaxError that needs to be replaced with <code>Errno::ENOENT</code>. Here's what we end up with after making those changes:</p>

<p>```ruby
describe "when parsing the post selector" do</p>

<pre><code>it "should have a post_selector" do
  @options.post_selector.should eq('.entry-content')
end

it "should raise an exception if the post selector is empty" do
  expect { options = Tentacles::Options.new(relative_path + '/mocks/blank_uri.yml') }.to raise_error(Errno::ENOENT)
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
```
Ugh, hate to cut it short but looks like I'm going down a rabbit hole with validation. I'll pickup tomorrow to see if we can iron a lot of this out.</p>

    <id>http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/05/06/object-oriented-scraper-backed-with-tests</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>I just drank a ton of coffee and I'm blasting music in my headphones so this post my bit a bit more scatter-shot than most since I can't really focus :]</em></p>

<p>Yesterday I managed to build a pretty naive scraper using Nokogiri which would count how often each word was used in the first 10 posts of this blog. Basically scraping the home URL of the site and grabbing everything inside of the <code>div.entry-content</code> selector.</p>

<p>Today I want to convert it into a more OO library so it's a bit more modular and reusable. I also want to back everything with RSpec tests to get into the practice. While it won't be true TDD I'll try to write the tests for the library before putting the classes together.</p>

<h3>Design Decisions</h3>

<p>I'm calling the project <code>Tentacles</code> for now since it relates to my Octopress blog. I'm still trying to figure out exactly what the end product will be. So far I know that I want it to produce a page of statistics about my blog. I figure that for now it can be just one page with stats that cover the entire blog. In the future I might want to make it more granular so that each post can get special attention. For now it's easiest for me if I just think of the whole blog as a big data set and this page as the output.</p>

<p>I also know that since Octopress is heavily integrated with Rake that I'd probably like to trigger the process as part of a Rake task. IMO the logical place would be to amend Octopress' <code>rake generate</code> so that it not only builds our static pages but it also produces our statistics. Down the line I might want to change this but for now it seems OK to me.</p>

<p>Finally I figure I'll want to have some kind of configuration file so the parser knows what to look for.</p>

<p>For now I'm fine with the output being a plain text file with a few stats on it. We'll work on making the output more robust after we've figure out the basics of our module and integrated it with Rake.</p>

<p>Here's the folder structure I'm using:</p>

<ul>
<li>tentacles

<ul>
<li>bin      <em>&lt;--- contains our executable program</em>

<ul>
<li>tentacles</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>lib      <em>&lt;--- contains our library of classes</em>

<ul>
<li>crawler.rb</li>
<li>config.yml</li>
<li>runner.rb</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>spec      <em>&lt;--- contains our RSpec tests</em>

<ul>
<li>crawler_spec.rb</li>
<li>runner_spec.rb</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Playing with IRB</h3>

<p>One of the first issues I've run up against is figuring out how to play with my classes in IRB. Being new to Ruby I tend to build everything in one folder. Since this is my first time embarking on some actual modular structure I'm unsure how to require or include a module in IRB. What I've settled on for now is to <code>cd</code> into my lib folder and use the <code>-I</code> flag to set the <code>$LOAD_PATH</code>.</p>

<p>Here's the <code>grep</code> from the irb man page.</p>

<p><code>
-I path        Same as `ruby -I' .  Specifies $LOAD_PATH directory
</code></p>

<p>So we end up in <code>tentacles/lib</code> and call IRB like so:</p>

<p><code>
irb -I .
</code></p>

<p>And now we can require our classes</p>

<p><code>
irb -I .
1.9.3-p125 :001 &gt; require 'runner'
 =&gt; true # sweeet
</code></p>

<h3>Skeletons</h3>

<p>I'm going to create a basic <code>Runner</code> class so we can verify that the stuff in IRB is working properly.</p>

<p>Here's what I've thrown together:</p>

<p>```ruby
module Tentacles
  class Runner</p>

<pre><code>def initialize(config)
  # Load in our config file
end

def run
  puts 'run run run!'
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>and here's how we test it in IRB.</p>

<p>```
irb -I .
require 'runner'</p>

<p>runner = Tentacles::Runner.new('foo')
 => #&lt;Tentacles::Runner:0x007faeb284ec30></p>

<p>runner.run
run run run!
 => nil
```</p>

<p>Looks good so far!</p>

<h3>Tests</h3>

<p>OK on to the tests then. I'm going to be using RSpec so if you don't have that setup already you should do a <code>gem install rspec</code>.</p>

<p>I'm a total noob when it comes to testing so let me take my best stab at this...</p>

<p>I'm going to write tests for <code>Runner</code> first since it's already stubbed out. I want to make sure of the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>It should respond to the <code>run</code> method</li>
<li>When I pass it an invalid config file it should throw an error</li>
<li>When I pass it an empty string or nil in place of config it should throw an error</li>
</ul>


<p>For now that's the only public API this object has. Pretty simple but of course I'm immediately running into issues. Here's what my spec looks like:</p>

<p>```ruby tentacles/spec/runner_spec.rb
require_relative '../lib/tentacles/runner'</p>

<p>describe Tentacles::Runner do</p>

<p>  before do</p>

<pre><code>@runner = Tentacles::Runner.new('config.yml')
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  subject { @runner }</p>

<p>  it { should respond_to(:run) }</p>

<p>  describe "when passing the config file" do</p>

<pre><code>it "should raise an error if the config file is missing" do
  expect { runner = Tentacles::Runner.new('') }.to raise_error(Errno::ENOENT)
  expect { runner = Tentacles::Runner.new(nil) }.to raise_error(TypeError)
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```
and here's what runner.rb looks like:</p>

<p>```ruby tentacles/lib/tentacles/runner.rb
require 'yaml'</p>

<p>module Tentacles
  class Runner</p>

<pre><code>def initialize(config)
  @config = YAML.load(File.open(config))
end

def run      
  'Runner should be running'
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```
aaaaaand here's the error:</p>

<p>```bash
1) Tentacles::Runner</p>

<pre><code> Failure/Error: @runner = Tentacles::Runner.new('config.yml')
 Errno::ENOENT:
   No such file or directory - config.yml
 # ./lib/tentacles/runner.rb:10:in `initialize'
 # ./lib/tentacles/runner.rb:10:in `open'
 # ./lib/tentacles/runner.rb:10:in `initialize'
 # ./spec/runner_spec.rb:8:in `new'
 # ./spec/runner_spec.rb:8:in `block (2 levels) in &lt;top (required)&gt;'
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>It looks like the test is bailing out on my <code>before</code> block when I try to create an instance of runner and pass it the config file. Folks on IRC are kind enough to point out that <code>require</code> and methods run in RSpec don't necessarily have the same scope so trying <code>../lib/tentacles/config.yml</code> won't work either. The solution is to use <code>File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../lib/tentacles/config.yml'</code>. Since I don't want my line lengths to get any longer I define a helper module and give it a <code>relative_path</code> method which should spit out <code>File.dirname(__FILE__)</code>.</p>

<p>```ruby tentacles/spec/helpers.rb
module Helpers
  def relative_path</p>

<pre><code>File.dirname(__FILE__)
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```
After I include it my tests look like this:</p>

<p>```ruby tentacles/spec/runner_spec.rb
require_relative '../lib/tentacles/runner'
require 'helpers'</p>

<p>describe Tentacles::Runner do
  include Helpers</p>

<p>  before do</p>

<pre><code>@runner = Tentacles::Runner.new(relative_path + '/../lib/tentacles/config.yml')
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  subject { @runner }</p>

<p>  it { should respond_to(:run) }</p>

<p>  describe "when passing the config file" do</p>

<pre><code>it "should raise an error if the config file is missing" do
  expect { runner = Tentacles::Runner.new('') }.to raise_error(Errno::ENOENT)
  expect { runner = Tentacles::Runner.new(nil) }.to raise_error(TypeError)
end

it "should raise an error if the config file is invalid" do
  expect { runner = Tentacles::Runner.new(relative_path + '/mocks/invalid_yaml.yml') }.to raise_error(Psych::SyntaxError)
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>end
```
You'll also notice I added a test for an invalid yml file. Basically I created a mocks folder and tossed in a yaml file that's full of gibberish. Probably not the best way to mock stuff but whatever, i'm learning!</p>

<p>With that all of our tests for <code>Tentacles::Runner</code> are passing. Yay! But now it's 10:37pm and I gotta call it a night. We'll continue tomorrow by writing tests for <code>Tentacles::Crawler</code>. See ya!</p>
